Don't ask me where that desire comes from, but I find working on math problems fun. A few years ago I bought a probability textbook, which I learned about through an Amazon review by my intellectual hero, Nassim Taleb (&lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/review/RBJX110Q38V9V"&gt;here's the review&lt;/a&gt;). Since then it has mainly been sitting on my book shelf, but occasionally I leaf through it and try to refresh my memory on some concept or learn a new one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the book, I came across a very famous problem in probability called &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gambler%27s_ruin"&gt;The Gambler's Ruin&lt;/a&gt;. In the problem, we have the following scenario:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two players, Player A and Player B, play a series of consecutive gambling games until one of the players loses all their money. Player A starts with a dollars and Player B starts with b dollars and the loser pays one dollar to the winner in each game. Player A's chance of winning a game is &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt; and Player B's chance is &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(q\)&lt;/span&gt; (where &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p+q=1\)&lt;/span&gt;). What is the probability, at any level of wealth Player A is at, that he will be ruined?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not hard to find a solution for this problem online. I even found an okay explanation of it by the &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr2iSKlengg&amp;amp;t"&gt;author of my textbook on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. However, I was a bit rusty on some of my math and found all the answers out there to be a bit hand wavy in their derivations. They go through the most confusing steps with no explanation, which was frustrating for me. I like simple, straightforward explanations. And since I couldn't find a single one on the Internet, I decided to contribute it myself. So let's walk through the problem, very slowly, step by step. If you follow me with a pencil and paper I guarantee you'll be able to understand the math. My goal is to be as comprehensive and thorough as possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The Setup&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you even start with this problem? The question above asks "What is the probability, at any level of wealth Player A is at, that he will be ruined?". So let's call this &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P_n\)&lt;/span&gt;.  &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P_n\)&lt;/span&gt; is the probability that when Player A has n dollars, he will ultimately be ruined. How does Player A get to a position where he has n dollars? Well there are two ways he can get there: He can either lose a game when he has n + 1, or he can win a game when he has n - 1. We know the probability of him winning and losing a game is &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(q\)&lt;/span&gt;, respectively, and we know these are mutually exclusive events. Therefore, we can write out the equation for &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P_n\)&lt;/span&gt; as &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{equation} P_n=pP_{n+1}+qP_{n-1} \end{equation}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get there by applying the theorem of total probability if you want to start at first principles, but I think the equation makes sense without any more set up. So we have our equation to solve!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Initial conditions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two initial conditions can help us solve the problem. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P_0=1$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This says that when Player A has $0, he is ruined. When Player A runs out of money, he can no longer play the game, so he's stuck in this state. His probability of ruin is therefore 1, since he has no chance of getting back in the action. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P_{a+b}=0$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt; This says the opposite. If Player A has won both his $a and Player B's $b, he has won all the dollars. Player B can no longer play, so the game is over and Player A has no chance of being ruined.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Solving a difference equation.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Equation &lt;span class="math"&gt;\((1)\)&lt;/span&gt; is known as a difference equation. I haven't solved too many of them, or at least been aware that I was, and maybe you're in the same boat. We can rewrite equation &lt;span class="math"&gt;\((1)\)&lt;/span&gt; as &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{equation} p(P_{n+1}-P_n) = q(P_n-P_{n-1})\end{equation}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
or &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P_{n+1}-P_n=\frac{q}{p}(P_n-P_{n-1})$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully you're still with me. All we did to get &lt;span class="math"&gt;\((2)\)&lt;/span&gt; was use the fact that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p+q=1\)&lt;/span&gt; and multiply the left hand side &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P_n\)&lt;/span&gt; by &lt;span class="math"&gt;\((p+q)\)&lt;/span&gt;. The next part of the solution I got stuck on a bit. In most of the derivations I saw, we go from the above equation, to &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{equation} P_{n+1}-P_n=\frac{q}{p}(P_n-P_{n-1})=(\frac{q}{p})^n(P_1-1) \end{equation}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Huh? How'd we get there? Let me show you. Let's try plugging in some numbers. First let's say &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(n=1\)&lt;/span&gt;. Plug that into &lt;span class="math"&gt;\((3)\)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P_2-P_1=\frac{q}{p}(P_1-P_0)$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
But we know from our initial conditions that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P_0=1\)&lt;/span&gt;, so:
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P_2-P_1=\frac{q}{p}(P_1-1)$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great, now let's try for &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(n=2\)&lt;/span&gt;. Plugged into (3) gives
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P_3-P_2=\frac{q}{p}(P_2-P1)$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see a pattern emerging here. But you can also see that the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\((P_2-P_1)\)&lt;/span&gt; in the above equation was already solved for in the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(n=1\)&lt;/span&gt; scenario. So we can simply plug that in.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P_3-P_2=\frac{q}{p}\frac{q}{p}(P_1-1)=(\frac{q}{p})^2(P_1-1)$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now consider the general case with &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(n\)&lt;/span&gt;. Feel free to try with &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(n=3\)&lt;/span&gt; if you haven't gotten the pattern. If you keep iterating, you'll continue to wind up with something that equals &lt;span class="math"&gt;\((\frac{q}{p})^n(P_1-1)\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fun with Geometric Sequences&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's take another route now. We've simplified &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P_{n+1}-P_n\)&lt;/span&gt;, but what about when we're not just looking at a difference of 1 game? Let's exploit our other initial condition of &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P_{a+b}=1\)&lt;/span&gt; and solve for &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P_{a+b}-P_n\)&lt;/span&gt;. Again, let's plug in some numbers. Let's say &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(n=1\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(a+b=3\)&lt;/span&gt;. Now we have &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P_3-P_1\)&lt;/span&gt;. From the work we did above we know &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P_3-P_2\)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P_2-P_1\)&lt;/span&gt;, and adding those together gives us &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P_3-P_1\)&lt;/span&gt;. We could also write that as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P_3-P_1=$\sum\limits_{k=1}^{2}P_{k+1}-P_k$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or more generally
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P_{a+b}-P_{n}=$\sum\limits_{k=n}^{a+b-1}P_{k+1}-P_k$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can plug in our solution for &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P_{n+1}-P_n\)&lt;/span&gt; from &lt;span class="math"&gt;\((3)\)&lt;/span&gt; into the &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P_{k+1}-P_k\)&lt;/span&gt; and get &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{equation} =\sum\limits_{k=n}^{a+b-1}(\frac{q}{p})^k(P_1-1) \end{equation}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we'd like to get rid of that summation term. This is a geometric series, so there's a very cool trick we can perform here to get find what that summation is equal to. I had completely forgotten about learning this trick in grad school. Like I said, my math is very rusty and I'm sure yours is too. So here's how you solve for it. Let's call the sequence &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\sum\limits_{k=n}^{a+b-1}(\frac{q}{p})^k=S_k\)&lt;/span&gt;. Okay, let's start expanding it out:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{equation} S_k=\frac{q}{p}^n+\frac{q}{p}^{n+1}+...+\frac{q}{p}^{a+b-1} \end{equation}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now the trick, where we multiply each side by &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\frac{q}{p}\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{equation} \frac{q}{p}S_k=\frac{q}{p}^{n+1}+\frac{q}{p}^{n+2}+...+\frac{q}{p}^{a+b} \end{equation}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And let's subtract &lt;span class="math"&gt;\((6)\)&lt;/span&gt; from &lt;span class="math"&gt;\((5)\)&lt;/span&gt;. Almost all the terms on the right hand side cancel out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$ S_k - \frac{q}{p}S_k =\frac{q}{p}^n - \frac{q}{p}^{a+b} $$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$ (1-\frac{q}{p})S_k =\frac{q}{p}^n - \frac{q}{p}^{a+b} $$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$ S_k =\frac{\frac{q}{p}^n - \frac{q}{p}^{a+b}}{1-\frac{q}{p}} $$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very cool, right? We can plug that back in for the summation in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\((4)\)&lt;/span&gt; and get&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{equation} P_{a+b}-P_{n}=(P_1-1)\frac{\frac{q}{p}^n - \frac{q}{p}^{a+b}}{1-\frac{q}{p}} \end{equation}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Home stretch!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're basically home free now. Recall that &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P_{a+b}=0\)&lt;/span&gt; and then multiply both sides by &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(-1\)&lt;/span&gt; to get&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{equation} P_n=(1-P_1)\frac{\frac{q}{p}^n - \frac{q}{p}^{a+b}}{1-\frac{q}{p}} \end{equation}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've almost written this in terms of only &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(n,a, and b\)&lt;/span&gt;, but we still don't know what &lt;span class="math"&gt;\((1-P_1)\)&lt;/span&gt; is. We can take care of that by using the other initial condition again &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P_0=1\)&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;\begin{equation} P_0=(1-P_1)\frac{\frac{q}{p}^0 - \frac{q}{p}^{a+b}}{1-\frac{q}{p}}=1 \end{equation}&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can now divide $(8) by 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P_n=\frac{(1-P_1)}{(1-P_1)}\frac{(\frac{q}{p}^n - \frac{q}{p}^{a+b})(1-\frac{q}{p})}{(\frac{q}{p}^0 - \frac{q}{p}^{a+b})(1-\frac{q}{p})}$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which you can see a lot can be cancelled out from. Also, &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\frac{q}{p}^0=1\)&lt;/span&gt;. That gives us
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P_n=\frac{(\frac{q}{p})^n - (\frac{q}{p})^{a+b}}{1-(\frac{q}{p})^{a+b}}$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And if we substitute &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(n=a\)&lt;/span&gt;, we can then factor out a &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(\frac{q}{p}^{a+b}\)&lt;/span&gt; from the numerator and denominator and we'll get the probability of ruin for player A when his wealth is a.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="math"&gt;$$P_a=\frac{1 - \frac{p}{q}^b}{1-\frac{p}{q}^{a+b}}$$&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which is our answer! That's quite a bit of math, but laid out step by step with explanations it's very straightforward. Now that we've got our solution, let's build some intuition around that last equation and simulate some gambling scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Intuition and moral of The Gambler's Ruin&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The earliest mention of this problem was in a letter from Blaise Pascal to Pierre Fermat in 1656. That was obviously pre-Vegas. Today, the problem is often used as a cautionary tale for anyone naive enough to think they can beat the house on their next trip to the casino. As we'll see with some simulations, as long as the odds are slightly not in your favor, you will always go broke. And when you're playing against a rich opponent, like say, a deep pocketed casino, you're basically fucked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So moral of the story: If you're playing a gambling game like the one described in this problem, quit while (and if) you're ahead. Roulette is probably the most relevant game to this problem. Roulette has nearly symmetric payout odds, with the odds just slightly tipped towards the house. If you go to Vegas and play one dollar roulette, you will eventually go broke. The same is true for any game in the casino, except for poker.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Let's Simulate!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I find the best way to build intuition on a tough mathematical result is to run some simulations. We've got our solution for &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(P_a\)&lt;/span&gt; in terms of the win probabilities p and q and the total capital the players are currently at, which are a and b.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let's play around with these values. The formula is pretty easy to write in a programming language - I'll use R here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;prob_ruin_a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# probability of Player B winning is q&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# since p + q have to = 1&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# The ratio of q/p, which we used in the solution&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;ratio&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Numerator of the solution&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ratio&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;^&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# and Denominator&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;den&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ratio&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;^&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;den&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Let's try a few values. First let's make the game only slightly in favor of player B but give him more and more wealth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;b_wealth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;100&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;500&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;5000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;b_wealth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&amp;gt;%&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;map_dbl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;prob_ruin_a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.499&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.5498341&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.5994213&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.7306926&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.8711488&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.9724110&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.9966294&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.0000000&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.0000000&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We're giving almost equal odds. Player A will win the game 49.9% of the time. When they both start with $50, the chances of ruin for Player A not too bad at 55%. But even with Player B having $100, the probability of ruin for A is already at 73%, and if B has $1000 the probability of ruin is 99.7%! At $1000, Player B simply has too much in reserve for Player A to stand a chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a bunch of values for Player B's wealth from $50 to $1000, we can see the probability of ruin for Player A increases exponentially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="ProbabilityPlayerA" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1427277/25469301/45030eb6-2ad0-11e7-8ab3-7a1ff2f88ca6.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that's when the odds are almost even! Let's now keep Player A and Player B's wealth both at $50, but let's change p, the probability Player A has of winning a game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;prob_p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;seq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;49&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;by&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.01&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;data_frame&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;prob_p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;prob_ruins&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;%&amp;gt;%&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yikes! Even if they have the same amount to begin with, even a slight unbalance in &lt;span class="math"&gt;\(p/q\)&lt;/span&gt; spells disaster for Player A. A 48% chance of winning a game leads to a 98% chance of ruin!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In conclusion, even if you think you are "lucky" or somehow naively believe you are skilled at games of chance, stay away from anything that resembles this problem in the real world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope you found the math easy to follow and let me know in the comments if you have any questions!&lt;/p&gt;

However, I spend &lt;em&gt;a lot&lt;/em&gt; of time both cooking and watching cooking videos on YouTube. To the point where I've nearly developed a bedtime dependency on a few YouTube videos in bed to help me fall asleep. It's not good, but not the worst thing either - so I carry on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My love of cooking began in grad school. I was going to school in Barcelona, which is one of the most fun cities to party and eat in. However, I was super stressed at the time and doing none of that. My Master's program was way more rigorous than I could have ever imagined, and I was panicking. For the first time in my life, I considered dropping out of school. Needless to say, going out to the clubs until 7 am, was not really an option. But everyone needs some time each day to unwind and let the mind release. For me, I was able to find those peaceful moments while shopping for groceries, coming home, and cooking for an hour or so. Spain has amazing grocery stores - comparable/better than some of the best markets we have here in Berkeley but at a lower price point. And speaking of low price points, I could get a great bottle of Rioja for around 5 euros, considerably less than a bottle of California Cabernet or Zinfandel that I'd probably pay $15 for back home.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="blogImage" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1427277/23641983/a611536c-02ac-11e7-894c-45f1d03f1064.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Seared Chicken Breast with Carrot Puree. Puree goodness, cooked with Joule&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since then I've been honing my cooking technique, and that involves watching a lot of cooking shows, reading a lot of cooking blogs and magazines, and filling my kitchen up with gear and gadgets to make my cooking better and more enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some time around a year ago, I started following a Seattle based startup called &lt;a href="https://www.chefsteps.com/"&gt;Chefsteps&lt;/a&gt; on YouTube. Their videos were elegant, beautiful, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqXjCFNX6HQ"&gt;and often way over my head&lt;/a&gt;. It was basically food porn. Half of the videos either called for some crazy ingredient, like ascorbic acid, or required a centerfuge and a vacuum sealer. Most of their videos showed off this sleek sous vide product they were developing called Joule. For those who don't know what sous vide is, it's a cooking technique where you put your food in a bag or vacuum sealed pouch, drop it in a water bath where the temperature is precisely controlled, and let your food gradually reach its desired temperature. The main advantage of cooking this way is that your food is guaranteed to come out at the perfect temperature. For years sous vide has been a mainstay in restaurant kitchens, and over the past few years we've begun to see sous vide tools hit the home cook market.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="blogImage" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1427277/23641987/a9a3e184-02ac-11e7-9d36-8ba5cda32b45.png" /&gt;
&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Eggs Benedict I made for my girlfriend after a week of dog sitting. Poached the eggs and made the hollandaise at the same sous vide temp.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After watching a few videos of perfectly cooked salmon, steak, and fried chicken, I decided I wanted a Joule. To seal the deal, I &lt;a href="https://pi.co/chris-young/"&gt;read a really fascinating interview of their cofounder by Om Malik&lt;/a&gt;. Then, I think it was around July, they went on sale for $150 with an unknown shipping date. I tossed the Chefsteps team $150 and waited patiently until around early November when it finally came. I normally don't like to purchase what I consider v1 products, but I had become such a fan of the company that I was willing to take a chance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any design obsessed, tech driven product company in the post-Steve-Jobs-era knows that packaging, messaging, and unboxing are sacred. I remember being really excited to open Joule, and they truly delivered on making that experience very iPhone-esque. And I'm talking iPhone 2, when it still meant something. After testing out that it worked, I hopped on my bike and picked up a piece of salmon at Berkeley Bowl, brought it back, and cooked it to a perfect 122 degrees. I gave it a quick sear on very high heat to crisp up the skin, which unfortunately got slightly stuck to my pan, and dug in. While it wasn't the most beautiful piece of fish, it tasted great and like the salmon, I was hooked!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="blogImage" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1427277/23887338/72c28af2-083e-11e7-8e3b-5ceec1065980.JPG" /&gt;
&lt;span class="caption"&gt;Valentine's day New York Steak, cooked in a hotel room in Mendocino. Pro Tip: Take your sous vide device on your next vacation. Cook anywhere.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, I've probably done around 20 or so cooks with Joule. From weeknight chicken breasts (which are absolutely nothing like the boneless, skinless ones you formed an image of already in your head), to a 2-bone Christmas prime rib roast, I've gotten a lot of value from Joule. In fact, when I look at all the fancy things I've filled my kitchen with, Joule easily has the most utility of all the products I've spent over $100 bucks on, with the sole exception of my chef's knife. I use it probably 100x more often than my food processor, and probably around 5x more often than my Le Creuset dutch oven. Still, my kitchen tongs reign supreme as the most useful thing I've ever purchased for cooking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It sounds hyperbolic, but I can really say this product has significantly improved my life. How? I'd say it comes down to these three points&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Cooking is (even more) stress free&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooking is a way for me to relax. However, it can be stressful at times. Like when you've got a piece of meat on the stove, some vegetables in the oven, and are chopping up something for a salad. It's all delicious, but to bring it all together at the last minute so nothing gets cold and soggy can take some Beautiful Mind style calculations. The constraint on the timing side is usually bound to the protein, since that's the thing you really don't want to overcook. Cooking sous vide eliminates that completely, since you can generally leave your proteins in the water bath for at least an hour after they've come up to temperature. So now, if I'm roasting some carrots and making a salad along with a pork chop or chicken thighs, I don't let the meat play conductor in my culinary symphony. Once I've got everything else cooked, table set, and all is in its place, I take my perfectly cooked proteins out and give them a quick sear and I'm all ready. Even if I'm keeping my dinners real simple, it's still nice to not have to huddle over a pan on the stove. I just get home from work, heat the water, drop in the proteins, and then go pour a glass of wine, meditate, turn on Netflix, or do whatever I need to do to get the relaxation vibes flowing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. I actually bring my lunch to work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ever since I left a cushy job at a major tech company that served me free gourmet food every single day for a slightly less cushy tech job where I had to go get my lunch, I've realized that buying your lunch in San Francisco sucks. It's really expensive and not that good. One of the cool things for me about cooking sous vide is that instead of cooking one chicken breast for dinner, I'll just cook two. I'll pop the other one in the fridge over night, and in the morning give it a quick sear, toss it together with some salad and other leftovers, and boom I have a beautiful lunch. Good value, healthy ingredients, and my coworkers are always impressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. The "less meat" paradox&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can cook vegetables sous vide, but for the most part it's meant to cook meat. Other than eggs, I've only cooked chicken, fish, pork and beef with Joule. However, even though I use it several times a week I've probably decreased my meat consumption over that time. What is this, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson's_paradox"&gt;Simpson's paradox&lt;/a&gt;? Well, sort of. It goes back to point #1. With sous vide, cooking meat tends to take at least an hour, almost all of which is spent not worrying about the cooking process. Some days I like to just chill and wait it out, but more often than not I spend that hour making other stuff. Whether it be roasted brussels sprouts, steamed broccoli, salads with no dressing (I know, I'm weird, but that's for another post), or taking some day old rice and turning it into delicious fried rice, that hour allows me to fill my dinner plate with lots of delicious non-meat options. I still may not be &lt;a href="http://michaelpollan.com/reviews/how-to-eat/"&gt;dogmatically following Michael Pollan's food rules&lt;/a&gt;, but I'm getting closer!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Bonus: Fish-intimidation is a thing of the past&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cooking fish used to mean salmon. I'd cook other seafood like shrimp and scallops, and of course indulge in already cooked, chilled, and cracked dungeness crab. But I knew I'd always fuck up the more tender fishes, like halibut, sablefish, artic char, and sea bass. I'd order them at fancy restaurants and pay absorbent prices since I never felt like they were approachable at home. Now, I fear no fish!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="blogImage" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1427277/23887371/be8638f8-083e-11e7-94be-cff29af59121.jpg" /&gt;
&lt;span class="caption"&gt;"Nobu" style Black Cod. De Niro would be proud.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have no affiliation with Chefsteps (if they were an SF company I might apply for a job) and am not getting paid to write this post (I doubt I have more than 3 or 4 readers anyway). I won't leave any links to go purchase Joule either, but I highly recommend a sous vide tool if you're a fan of cooking. There are others out there, most notably the Anova. Joule, however, looks the prettiest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some more gratuitous cooking photos for your enjoyment!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="blogImage" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1427277/23643835/f9638bd2-02b8-11e7-9308-819ec70e52c7.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's me! Making some fried chicken. How is that sous vide? Well first you cook all the chicken parts sous vide, and give them a quick fry after flour-ing them up. That way you only fry them for a few minutes, instead of 20+ minutes the traditional way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="blogImage" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1427277/23643834/f962afe6-02b8-11e7-84ec-9a23ba8dd0fb.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it came time to plate the fried chicken, photography was the last thing on my mind. So this is the closest to "final product" I got. This was probably the most delicious thing I've ever cooked. Because the chicken was pre cooked sous vide, I didn't need to fry it the standard 20 minutes. That left the insides incredibly juicy.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Tim Abraham</dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 01 Apr 2017 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate><guid>tag:timabe.me,2017-04-01:posts/2017/04/joule_review/</guid><category>cooking</category><category>life</category></item><item><title>Bootstrap your Analytics in 1 hour or Less</title><link>http://timabe.me/posts/2017/01/one_hr_analytics/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*xfavpsRMhnfgQbQ-7SkESg.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Data is well understood to be critical to any company’s success. Ironically,
many startups tend to shy away from analytics — especially early on. I believe
this partially stems from a myth that if you want to have analytics you should
carve out around 25% of your engineering resources to fund it. To a founder with
a vision, a 25% distraction from executing on that vision in exchange for some
visibility and insight is too expensive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But setting up some basic analytics for your product isn’t nearly as difficult
as you think!&lt;/strong&gt; Certainly nowhere near 25% of engineering. While that may be
true for mature companies with many large and complicated data pipelines, a
small company can easily roll something up with minimal costs. &lt;strong&gt;To prove it,
I’m going to show you how you can spend 1 hour setting up a system that should
be adequate for the next 6 months of your company’s life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let’s talk about what I mean by “having analytics”. I think the minimum
requirements are&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simple access to your key metrics for everyone in your company&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A nightly stats email or slack message going out to your team&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A few hosted dashboards to put up on monitors in the office&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A place where anyone in your company can explore data (regardless of technical
acumen)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, you need &lt;strong&gt;metrics &lt;/strong&gt;and &lt;strong&gt;a way to spread them throughout your
organization&lt;/strong&gt;. Let’s begin with the metrics part:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Your Metrics are Already in your Database&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since pie is way more delicious than widgets, let’s imagine you’ve just started
&lt;a href="https://github.com/timabe/pies"&gt;a pie delivery company&lt;/a&gt;. You decide that at a
minimum, the success of your business will depend on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your ability to get potential pie consumers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your ability to sell pies to those consumers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*yPRxRb5UghNa-EZmeuuteg.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you can reliably grow both 1 and 2 you won’t have too much else to worry
about. You decide based on that to track&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;New user registrations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pie sales&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat usage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You know you can derive a few more interesting metrics just based off of user
registration and pie sale data, but for now you’re cool with these big 3 high
level metrics. Now how do you actually make these?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At this point a lot of people head to Google Analytics, Mixpanel, or some other
3rd party event analytics provider. While I love these products, and I love
event analytics, I also think that this is part of the reason why early stage
startups punt on analytics. To set these up the right way means engineering time
spent on something orthogonal to developing your core product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So before you make a case for the engineering team to spend a cycle
instrumenting user signups and pie sales, consider this: &lt;strong&gt;these metrics are
probably already in your application database.&lt;/strong&gt; In other words, if you’re
building a product to delivery pie to users and you don’t have a database table
or collection to store your users or the pies they’ve ordered . . . well then a
lack of analytics is not your biggest concern. Remember, a piece of software is
basically made up of data and logic to operate on that data. Many don’t realize
that data in your application can actually be used for analytics as well. So
feel free to put your event analytics instrumentation in the backlog and let’s
see how much we can get done with just your application database.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now how do you get these metrics out?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/0*PpCld0A2l3pM9dpq." /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Metabase: An analytics tool that works with your database&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of ways to fetch information from a database, but there is only
one &lt;em&gt;easiest&lt;/em&gt; way, and this post is about easy ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite tool that I recommend for any company I advise is
&lt;a href="http://www.metabase.com/"&gt;Metabase&lt;/a&gt;. Metabase is the fastest, easiest way to
share data and analytics inside your company. It’s super simple to install or
deploy, works with almost all databases, and best of all is open source and 100%
free — so you should definitely test it out first before you go with some of the
paid options out there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Full disclosure: I work at &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="http://expa.com/"&gt;expa&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, where Metabase was
started, and I am an advisor to the company. I have also, in just the past year,
advised 8 different technology startups on data and analytics and in each case
have recommended Metabase for them. They all continue to use it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Installation/Deployment&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are just in evaluation mode, I would recommend downloading Metabase’s
&lt;a href="http://www.metabase.com/start/mac.html"&gt;mac app&lt;/a&gt;. Follow their &lt;a href="http://www.metabase.com/docs/v0.20.3/setting-up-metabase.html"&gt;setup
guide&lt;/a&gt;, and
you’re ready to create some metrics. However, deploying Metabase either on
&lt;a href="http://www.metabase.com/docs/v0.20.3/operations-guide/running-metabase-on-heroku.html"&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt;
or &lt;a href="http://www.metabase.com/docs/v0.20.3/operations-guide/running-metabase-on-elastic-beanstalk.html"&gt;AWS Elastic
Beanstalk&lt;/a&gt;
(best) is highly recommended, as you’ll get a persistent application that’s
hosted in the cloud and your whole team can use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a full guide on the deployment process, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wmJ02K8LIFk"&gt;check out my video
tutoria&lt;/a&gt;l. Metabase’s
&lt;a href="http://www.metabase.com/docs/v0.20.3/operations-guide/start.html#installing-and-running-metabase"&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;
is pretty comprehensive, as well. If you’re a non-technical person, you may have
to shoulder-tap an engineer, especially if your application database is in a VPC
on AWS. On that note, it’s also a good idea to create a read replica of your
application database and plug that into Metabase. That way you can ensure any
heavy duty or hanging queries won’t affect your users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once you get Metabase deployed, sign up and add your database credentials. Next,
invite your team members so they can get in on the fun.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Creating your metrics&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not, the rest is pretty easy. The first thing you’ll want to do is
build your metrics. In Metabase parlance, these are “Questions”. If you’re the
pie business, and you have a reasonably organized schema, you should be able to
get your key metrics with just a few clicks. No SQL is required, but of course
if you like SQL that option is available.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So build your top metrics, and see if any other interesting ones pop into your
mind. Although you can find &lt;a href="https://www.quora.com/How-and-why-are-pie-charts-considered-evil-by-data-visualization-experts"&gt;hundreds of smart people who will tell you to never
make a pie
chart&lt;/a&gt;,
I won’t hate on you for making a pie chart based on pie popularity. If metabase
is the meta database, it’s only right to make your pie chart meta.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Finishing touches&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next you’ll want to setup a daily stats email. I don’t know what it is about
them, but everyone loves daily stats emails. Metabase calls these “Pulses”, and
even lets you use Slack if you’re too cool for email. Simply add the Questions
you want to send out, pick a time and cadence (it doesn’t have to be daily but
that tends to be the most helpful, IMO) and a list of recipients or slack
channel and you’re done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lastly, everyone loves to see pretty dashboards up on the monitors in the
office. Don’t keep them in suspense. Making a dashboard is also quite
straightforward. Pick some Questions and organize them as best as your design
sensibilities allow you. Load it up on an external monitor you’ve got up in the
office, full-screen it, and you’re done!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Recap&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You just set up a pretty solid analytics infrastructure for your startup in
about an hour. Now your whole team can explore your application database,
receive nightly emails, and view a company-wide dashboard. Even better, This
setup should last you for quite some time — at least 6 months unless you start
experiencing crazy growth (in which case, no complaining).&lt;/p&gt;

I always liked reading books but most of my reading at the time was consumed by the New Yorker magazine. As much as I loved that magazine (and still do), I decided I would drop the subscription and start reading books. Finding little time during the week to get solid reading sessions in, I began a new practice: I started waking early in the morning to give myself time to read, meditate, and drink coffee before leaving for work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love that reading books gives me the opportunity to explore topics I'm interested in deeply. Over the last two years I've read a lot about history, Zen, technology, economics, and cryptography - all big interests of mine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a quick analysis I put together of my reading over the past two years. I hope it motivates me to continue this great hobby in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Pulling data about my reading habits&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find a list of everything I've read going back to 2015 on &lt;a href="https://kit.com/timabe/books-i-read-2015-2016"&gt;my kit page&lt;/a&gt;. Since I got most of my books on Amazon, it was pretty easy to download a csv of all the books I've read, along with their ISBN number. I can also use the order dates to roughly guess when I started and finished each book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found that by using the &lt;a href="https://developers.google.com/books"&gt;Google Books API&lt;/a&gt;, I could look up extra information on the books by ISBN number and get things like number of pages, categories, publish date, and such. Here's a quick example of an R function I wrote that wraps up the functionality to pings the API. You just feed it the title of the book and the ISBN code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;google_book_info&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;isbn_code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;results&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;api_key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;tolower&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;str_replace_all&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pattern&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39; &amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;replacement&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;+&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;library&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;jsonlite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;api_key&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;lt;My API Key&amp;gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# not necessary but probably good&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# if you&amp;#39;re going to call the function a lot&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;paste0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;amp;isbn=&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;isbn_code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;amp;maxResults=&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;amp;key=&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;api_key&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class="n"&gt;fromJSON&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h4&gt;How much did I read?&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I read 13 books in both 2015 and 2016. That's about one a month. But I must have read much longer books in 2016, because I nearly doubled my pages read.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Pages by year" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1427277/21669772/5efe3274-d2c3-11e6-8180-c52a356f4df5.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't know how many hours that took, but I can back out an estimate. Let's say I read the average speed of 240 words per minute. I probably am a bit slower than average if anything, but we'll go with the global average here. Most books have about 300 words per page. That ends up equaling about 120 hours of reading time - or about 20 minutes a day. That sounds about right, given that I probably only read 5 days per week and it's usually for half an hour in the morning and a bit more on the train.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got to 5791 pages by the end of the year in a pretty uniform fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Cumulative pages" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1427277/21669775/5f036c8a-d2c3-11e6-8f5c-1f95a6d984b8.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Quickest and Slowest Reads&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The longest book I read was Neal Stephenson's &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptonomicon"&gt;Cryptonomicon&lt;/a&gt; and the shortest book was &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_Mind,_Beginner's_Mind"&gt;Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind&lt;/a&gt;, both classics in science fiction/cyberpunk and Zen Buddism.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some books I read very fast, while others I slogged through. According to this chart, and my own memory, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance"&gt;Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance&lt;/a&gt; took me a long time to read. It's another classic, but it's incredibly dense and way to philosophical for my liking. I brought that book on my two week summer vacation, too, so I bet had it not been for the extra reading time I had on that trip it would have taken even longer. I tend to read pop science books like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Better_Angels_of_Our_Nature"&gt;Better Angels of Our Nature&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quiet:_The_Power_of_Introverts_in_a_World_That_Can't_Stop_Talking"&gt;Quiet&lt;/a&gt;, a book about introversion, very fast. That matches my intuition - I like those kind of books and tend to not get distracted when I read them. I also sometimes pick and chose the parts I want to read in a book like that, which was the case with Mr. Pinker's book. I remember racing through &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_to_One"&gt;Zero to One&lt;/a&gt;, but I must have started it a few days before I really started digging in, as my pace was middle of the pack on that one.
&lt;img alt="Pages per Day" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1427277/21669774/5f01673c-d2c3-11e6-9741-8ddbe73ed5d5.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Genres&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2016 my favorite type of book to read dealt with Psychology. I read no Psychology books in 2015. Not a huge fiction reader, I dropped from 3 in 2015 to only 1 in 2016. Granted that one fiction book was almost 1200 pages. Still, I think I should try a few more in fiction in 2017. Any suggestions?
&lt;img alt="Genres" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1427277/21669861/137d70f2-d2c4-11e6-9149-1e3c31718d04.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Tim Abraham</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 03 Jan 2017 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate><guid>tag:timabe.me,2017-01-03:posts/2017/01/year-in-books/</guid><category>books</category><category>data</category><category>analysis</category></item><item><title>Antifragile</title><link>http://timabe.me/posts/2016/04/antifragile/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For my previous post on Nassim Taleb and what he's about, see &lt;a href="http://timabe.me/posts/2016/03/nnt/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not easy to summarize your favorite book. Capturing each idea from Antifragile as crisply and convincingly as it is done in the book is neither possible or appropriate for a blog post. So instead, I'll just explore some of the ideas from the book that I found most interesting. They are all tied together, and link back to the same central concept, but are different enough to expound upon individually.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;The Triad&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The word "Antifragile" means "something that gains from harm". It's not something we think about much. The closest word to it is "Robust", but that doesn't really capture it, as things that are robust are simply indifferent to harm. "Antifragile" is not in the dictionary. Most concepts we are familiar with are in the dictionary. However, it also turns out that ancient people living by the Medeterranean Sea had no word for "blue". Needing a rigorous definition makes things overly academic and detracts from the essence of the concept, so let's not worry about the word "Antifragile" being made up. Antifragile's opposite is fragile. Taleb thinks of these three words as three different domains that you can categorize just about everything into. Things either break under stress (fragile), they do nothing under stress (robust) or they get better under stress (antifragile). He refers to this as The Triad. It's a framework for thinking about all aspects of life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you apply harm (via volatility) to a porcelain coffee cup, the cup breaks. The cup is fragile to harm. If you apply that same harm to a rock, nothing is going to happen. The rock is robust. If you apply that harm to a human, provided it isn't violent enough to kill him, the human's body experiences some discomfort but also receive information and sends messages to prepare for similar amounts of harm in the future. The bones get more dense, the muscles get larger, or the reflexes get quicker. Depending on the type of harm, the body will learn from him and improve its fitness. That is antifragile. In general we see organic, bottoms up, crowdsourced, a-theoretic, natural, and ancient things belonging to the antifragile, while we see top down, scientific, academic, central, corporate, and artificial things belonging to the fragile domain. One of Nassim Taleb's concerns is that as society advances, more and more of our consumption, policies and decision making fall into the fragile column of the Triad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tend to naively believe that the fragile route is actually the safe route, too! One of my favorite anecdotes from this section was the thought experiment of two brothers. One worked as a midlevel manager in a bank, the other a taxi driver. The bank manager makes a predictable $500 per day, while the taxi driver sometimes makes $100, sometimes $200, and occasionally will bring home as much as $2000 per day. On average they earn about the same, but the banker's stable income makes his job seem more lucrative and enviable. However, on the worst month the taxi driver might make an average of $50 per day, but the worst month for the banker is the month where his bank is caught up in the latest financial crisis and he is completely blindsided, losing his job and possibly never recovering. The taxi driver will always have work, but never assumes he will. The banker always assumes he will have work, but ends up having none. And the outsider thinks the banker to be the better off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you pay attention, you realize this anecdote is all around us. We're always favoring ideas in the 3rd, fragile column of the triad over the antifragile ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Iaotrogenics and Naive Intervention&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know, more words that we've never heard of right? But iaotrogenics is actually a real world, originating from Greek, meaning "harm done by the healer". NNT writes a lot about this, and how through trying to do what's best, we often fragalize ourselves or the systems we live in. He starts with the fact that more people have been killed by hospitals than have been saved. Whether this is true is hard to discern. He argues (correctly) that every medical procedure or drug has some negative effect. If that weren't true, we would just all take that procedure. The only reason we should opt in should be if we can make large gains in health from the treatment. Any marginal gain we expect to gain is likely to be offset by the iatrogenics. Or think about public health. Some people think we can design an optimal diet. For years we were warned against eating saturated fats. Many alternative products came on the market, like margarine and products with transitional fats. We were told that these were much healthier, because they were designed by science instead of mother nature. We also were encouraged to replace our fatty foods with foods stuffed with carbohydrates and sugar. This was all supposed to be for our best interest, but now the tables have turned and turns out there is very little evidence that saturated fat consumption leads to the diseases it originally was thought to. However, as a result, we now have had to practically outlaw the "healthy", science-made transitional fat and the current battle in public health is now focused on sugar and carbohydrates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nassim Taleb believes that paying too much attention to the current advice from the medical journal, the nightly news, or the newspaper is bad for our health and mental state. Rather we should trust ancestral information, as it's much more antifragile. Everything with time is by definition more antifragile. Proof: since time is volatility, things that have survived throughout time are antifragile to that volatility. One of the best points he makes is against newspapers. We're taught since childhood that reading the newspaper is a mature thing we should all do to be respectable adults. It informs us to what is going on, and what we need to care about. However, did you ever notice that the newspaper is the same length just about every day (except for Sunday when they pack it with more glossy ads). Some days, very infrequent, there are events that we all need to know about and that have a bearing on our lives. But most days not much really happens in the grand scheme of things. Then why should we be expected to read the same amount of words each day? We end up mostly reading noise, and occasionally a bit of signal. To illustrate, I'll generate a random date from the last 10 years and link to the New York Time's front page that day. &lt;a href="http://query.nytimes.com/search/sitesearch/#/*/from20060601to20060601/document_type%3A%22article%22/"&gt;Here are the top articles from that day&lt;/a&gt;. The most popular article that day seems to be about a hot new company that provides you with the physical book you used to get in a CD jewel case when you bought physical music, but they offer it when you buy digital albums from iTunes. It's easy to scoff at it now. 10 years later no one cares about those books, and hardly anyone even buys digital albums let alone CDs, and that company never became the next big thing. Next time you pick up the paper and read about the latest technology company, remember this anecdote.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Via Negativa and the Lindy Effect&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, when we have something wrong with us we tend to look for something to take to make it better. This is across all domains, but probably most relatable in medicine. If you have a sore back, often you'll take something to make it feel better. If you are depressed, you might take an antidepressant to feel better. Even outside medicine, if you are trying to lose weight you might take the advice from the latest diet book, or stock up on vitamin pills, strange powders, and odd tastings roots. These are all additive solutions, meaning you are looking for something to take that will cancel out whatever you feel is unwanted. There are two big problems with this. One is that these solutions usually don't work, and often have iaotrogenics. Think about the medicines or diet fads over the past 30 years. Many of them are laughable, or outlawed today. The second is that they deprive your body from stressors. We think of stressors as bad, but in the antifragile domain they are good (provided they are in small doses).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where the concept "via negativa" or by subtraction, comes in. If I am getting headaches constantly, maybe it's not smart for me to look at what to add to my daily routine to counteract them. Instead, I might benefit from removing things systematically from my routine, until the headaches go away. The headaches might go away naturally (the body is really good at healing itself, just give it time), or I might stumble upon, through via negativa, the fact that drinking 4 cups of coffee each morning gives me terrible headaches and when I cut that to 2 I'm fine (this is all fictitious, I don't have headaches or drink 4 cups of coffee). In the end, that will be a much healthier solution than adding an aspirin on top of my 4 cups. That aspirin doesn't get rid of the underlying effect, it just counterbalances it in an unnatural way. Removing the 2 cups though, removes the underlying effect. Plus I learn, through experimenting and tinkering, that it was the extra 2 cups that caused the headaches. I might thank my headaches later, for signaling to me that I am doing something harmful. With the aspirin I never learn what the cause is, I just mask it, and the underlying problem festers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is really a beautiful idea, to me. Most of what goes wrong with us, or the world around us, can be solved by removing things, not adding things. But we always are looking for an additive solution. It seems easier, and when it's backed by science and academia we get even more excited about it. Sadly, those solutions always prove dangerous to us in the long run. Look at trans-fats, statins, vioxx, blood-letting, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look into the future and imagine what your life might be like. When we do this, we tend to dream up additional things that might be part of our daily lives. Flying cars, minority-report style augmented reality, meal replacement pills, robot servants. That, though, is an additive way of looking at the future. We take a snapshot of our current lives, and add new things to it. The smarter way to predict the future is via negativa. What won't survive into the future?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I had been asked 10 years ago to predict what my home would look like today, I probably would look at the products in my dorm room and extrapolate what they would be with 10 years of additional development. That would lead me to believe that my future house would have a nicely stocked DVD collection, a very well detailed library of MP3s sitting on my very fancy desktop computer. I'd be able to access my music, photos, books, and videos via their digital backups, which would be some sort of "digital library". Well, some of that is definitely in the right direction, but it's still very different from my world today. Most of these physical things that I imagined I'd have digital backups of have been completely replaced by their digital versions. I don't purchase new CDs, or DVDs. I don't develop physical photos, either. I don't have a digital library of books, although I constantly buy new books for my shelves (more on that later). I also would have missed most of the relevant technologies developed in those categories: mobile technologies, cloud computing, and streaming.Point being, predicting the future by extrapolating from your current reference point and imagining how the current technologies will evolve is fallacious. Instead, I should have looked at the present and imagined what technologies would go away and be replaced by entirely new ones. Had I done that, I might have instead predicted (correctly) that my discman and CD collection would suffer the same fate as the previous generation's walkmans and cassette tapes, or that my DVDs would suffer the same fate as VHS. I would have been right, too! Had I said the same thing about my book collection - that it would be replaced by an entirely new technology, I would have been mostly wrong. Of course we do have kindles today but they really haven't taken off and I certainly don't use them. So taking a via negativa approach would have been correct for &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; of my predictions, but not all. There happens to be, though, a categorical way of predicting whether a technology will remain in existence 10 years from now or fade into oblivion. Not coined, but furthered by Nassim Taleb, it's called the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect"&gt;Lindy Effect&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The claim behind the Lindy Effect is that a technology that has been around for X years will, on average, be around for another X years before being replaced by something else. This is very different from traditional survival analysis, which is generally used for human or other biological life. If a human is 78 years old, an actuarial professional will predict that that person will have another 10 years to live. If that person survives another 10 years, the actuarial will predict they have another 5 years to go, and so on. As the person gets older, their additional life expectancy goes down (albeit with a negative second derivative). However, if a book is in print for 78 years, it's likely that it will be in print for another 78 years. And if that book survives the next 78 years and has been in print for 156 years, it's probably going to survive an additional 156 years (and so on). The latest business book, or book on global warming, or politics in the age of Donald Trump may seem like it's an important book to read, but the Lindy Effect tells us it's probably not going to be relevant even 1 year from now. Compare that to something like the Bible, or Stoic Philosophy or Shakespeare. It's very likely our great grandchildren will have the same exposure to those as we did.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings us back to the thought experiment where I sat in my dorm and predicted what would and would not stick around 10 years later. The things that disappeared - the discman, the DVD collection, the digital library on my hard drive . . . these were all fairly recent technologies. The desktop computer is a bit older, about 30 years old at that time. We still have it today, but it's probably not long for this world as portable devices are replacing it for most of its functions. Books, however, have been around in some form for over a thousand years. The printing press, which made them widely available, has been around for 600 years. Last year I &lt;a href="http://timabe.me/pages/kit-list/"&gt;read about 20 books&lt;/a&gt;, all physical, and mostly purchased that year. So the oldest technology from my dorm room, books, are still going strong and likely will continue too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why is this true? It goes back to antifragility, via negativa, and the Triad. All technologies receive stressors and volatility. Time is a form of volatility, since the more time passes the more opportunity there is for random shocks, black swan events, and other stressors to occur. Anything that has survived for 1000 years has done well absorbing, or improving, from stressors. Those things are not likely to be destroyed by future random shocks (until one day, they eventually will be). Compare this to a new technology. It hasn't stood the test of time, and although it seems cool it could easily be replaced or made obsolete by something on the horizon. Remember in the 90s when Microsoft was constantly fighting anti-trust battles? Because they were so valuable, and so dominant (at the time), regulators were scared that they would become an all powerful monopoly. But they had only been around for 20 years or so. According to the Lindy Effect, we should not have been worried about them at all. Even though we can't predict the future, we can be confident that &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; would come along and dethrone them. And of course, that's exactly what happened. It's silly in hindsight that we should have regulated them on the basis of monopoly power - today they're mostly engaged in a game of lame catch up with the current tech giants and a constant supply of jokes on twitter whenever they release a new product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll end this essay with a quote I enjoyed from the book about the Lindy Effect and via negativa. It makes me feel good, that the future won't be an unfamiliar place of strange technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tonight I will be meeting friends in a restaurant (tavernas have existed for at least twenty-five centuries). I will be walking there wearing shoes hardly different from those worn fifty-three hundred years ago by the mummified man discovered in a glacier in the Austrian Alps. At the restaurant, I will be using silverware, a Mesopotamian technology, which qualifies as a "killer application" given what it allows me to do to the leg of lamb, such as tear it apart while sparing my fingers from burns. I will be drinking wine, a liquid that has been in use for at least six millennia. The wine will be poured into glasses, an innovation claimed by my Lebanese compatriots to come from their Phoenician ancestors, and if you disagree about the source, we can say that glass objects have been sold as trinkets for at least twenty-nine hundred years. After the main course, I will have a somewhat younger technology, artisanal cheese, paying higher prices for those that have not changed in their preparation for several centuries.&lt;/p&gt;

His ideas have had more influence on my way of thinking about the world than anything else - and by a long shot. I can remember back when I first read The Black Swan. I would go on really long walks and just think over it. It opened an intellectually curious side of me that has since never closed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This month I read Antifragile for my third time. I chose it over The Black Swan and Fooled By Randomness because NNT considers it is magnum opus, and it brings together a lot of ideas from his former books and builds some cohesiveness around the concepts. Rather than dive right into the contents of the book, I want to first wax a bit about what all these books, and the author himself, are generally getting at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I first discovered Nassim Taleb through a podcast called Econtalk that I used to listen to religiously. He's been on the show a few times now, and on one of his more recent appearances he was asked "how would you sum up your ideas?". The host was looking for a Rabbi Hillel style answer, who is famous for being asked "how would you sum up the Torah while standing on one foot?" to which he replied something to the tune of "do to others what you want them to do to yourself and the rest is just commentary". Nassim's answer was "I have just one idea: Decision making under opacity. Or what to do when you don't know what to do."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I think this perfectly sums up the idea of Antifragile, but what does it mean? I think the explanation is two-fold. First let's unpack decision making under opacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since the Enlightenment (and thanks a lot to the field of Economics which has bled into Political Science, Sociology, Psychology and basically all the soft sciences) we've been conditioned to think that we make rational decisions based on perfect information. We are taught this in school, and the leaders of today's world go get a higher education in this stuff at a place called Business School. They're taught tools to take into public life like "Expected Utility Theory", "Game Theory", "Decision Theory", and a bunch of other theories based on a big assumption that we are rational and have perfect information. But when do we ever have perfect information in the real world? Humans are complex, society is complex, and moreover Nature is complex. We don't fully understand any of them, so it's naive to think that we can predict what the outcomes of our decisions are going to be and go with the one that provides the best results. But look around at the world as it is today. Every person with a powerful position in political or economic life has been schooled by this form of naive rationalism. The people making the most important decisions are using tools that assume the world is a smooth, understandable, and simple place. I don't think I need to argue too hard to convince you that the world is not that simple. When we make decisions, we really don't know everything. That's what decision making under opacity means, and outside of casinos and a few board games, our decision making always has some opacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So most of the decisions we make we think we can "predict" the outcome of, but we really can't. Nassim argues that the field of predicting, and the statistics behind it, are often not a good fit for the problem. But they appear to be very rigorous, which gives us a false sense of security that we know what we're doing. This leads to a very scary thing called optimization. In it, we use our false ability to predict to expose ourself to even more risk if we are wrong. It can also lead to many unintended consequences, since the world is complex and like the butterfly effect we can't possibly compute all the potential outcomes. Two obvious examples are the financial crisis and the Iraq war. The financial crisis was largely caused by overconfidence on house prices - an overconfidence that led to a system designed to function nicely as long as prices ticked up, but to completely implode should they tick down. That system was largely the result of over optimizing. We used mathematical models, had prominent economists talk about the Great Moderation, and used the bell curve to rationalize phony regulations like the metric value-at-risk. The consequences of these bad decisions was about a trillion dollars in taxpayer bailouts, while Wall Street bankers were able to keep the insane bonuses they'd already banked. When we went to war with Iraq, George W Bush said he expected it to take a few weeks. He was only looking at the tip of the iceberg, and never saw the insurgency or fighting of Sunni and Shite Muslims. The fallout of the operation turned out to be 99% of the cost, death toll, and time. In both these cases people assumed they knew what they were doing, and that confidence led to even more risk taking which eventually caused huge costly blowups. We still don't even know if we've recovered from either, as there could be more hidden risks looming.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That brings us to "what to do when you don't know what to do". We need to make decisions. And we know that not every decision is going to lead to a good outcome. Nassim Taleb wants to live in a society where we can make errors, but with small costs that are locally confined. Currently, we do too much the opposite - our decisions have widespread consequences. NNT argues that we should seek policies that live in the domain where mistakes actually help the health of the system, rather than fully bringing the system and everything in its wake down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my next essay I'll get into some of the ideas from Antifragile. They'll always come back to this core concept.&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Tim Abraham</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 22 Mar 2016 21:56:40 -0700</pubDate><guid>tag:timabe.me,2016-03-22:posts/2016/03/nnt/</guid><category>books</category><category>essays</category></item><item><title>History of The Jews: A lengthy review of a lenghty book.</title><link>http://timabe.me/posts/2016/01/history-of-the-jews/</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Most of the books I read in 2015 were of the 200-300 page variety. I love reading but I also find myself distractingly looking forward to my next book before I finish my current one. As such, picking up this 600 page book with very tiny print felt like the equivalent of running a marathon when you are generally doing 5ks. There was a masochistic element, as well as a "let's see if I can do this" element.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Watching Fiddler on the Roof over Christmas break piqued my interest in the history of Jewish people. Seeing the provincial, bucolic town of Anatevka evoked a lot of Romantic feelings in me, and I became curious to read up on these types of places. I looked for the most general and well regarded history of Jews, and found &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/A-History-Jews-Paul-Johnson/dp/0060915331"&gt;this one&lt;/a&gt; by Paul Johnson who I later learned is held as one of the top historians of our time. While it didn't touch much on what life in Anatevka was like, I did learn a lot from the book . . . and here's my summary and take on it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But first, I'll complain a bit about what I didn't learn. I was really hoping to get a glimpse of a Jewish person's life throughout history. For example, what did a Jew, living in Israel under King David, do day to day? What did his house look like? What kind of food did he cook? What did he own? Did he go to school? What technologies were available to him at the time, and what did his government provide to him? What was the balance of religious Jewishness and secular/ethnic Jewishness in his life? I want to know the answer to these questions for all types of Jews - the original Jews, the Jews of the middle ages, the ghetto-ized Jews, the Jews of Anatevka and places like it, and even the Jews of far out places like China, India and Ehtiopia. Well, unfortunately this book did not satisfy my thirst for such knowledge. Maybe it's covered in some other books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now for what this book does cover, which is a lot. It is divided into chapters that are relatively self explanatory. It begins with Israelites, referring to the original Jewish people founded my the man who I get my last name from, Abraham (although I was actually raised Catholic). These people lived in Canaan, an area in the Southern Levant. Much of this chapter and the second chapter, Judaism, attempt to follow events in the Bible. For a religious person who wants to know the historical accuracy of certain parts of the Bible, this would be quite interesting. For me, who has limited knowledge of the Bible, it felt a bit too much like a master class and not the overview I was hoping to get. At a higher level though, these chapters get at the idea that Abraham invented ethical monotheism. This was an entirely new idea in a time where the other theology we know most about was Egyptian, with hundreds of gods and goddesses providing a quick and easy solution or origin story for all mankind's unknowns. From this, Johnson focuses on the idea of Judism as an extremely rational religion, and he keeps returning to that point throughout the book. The Jews are the chosen people of God and therefore have the responsibility of figuring out how to live in accordance to his laws. When I think about this, I see it having a major effect on how one would live their life: Instead of thinking that life is deterministic, or that we are all just actors in a play, one would instead believe that there is a right way to live, and the journey of life would be the study, discovery, and practice of this way. This leads to a lot of scholarship, a lot of focus on coming up with laws on how to live, and according to the author lays the groundwork that makes it so this ancient tribe of people survive throughout all of history.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first few chapters also focus on a lot of history. The Kingdom of Israel, the prophets, the wars, the Babylonian exile and the flip flopping of when the Jewish people had their own land and when they lost it and were conquered people. They seemed to be well treated as conquered people, although who knows what that would look like to us. There was a lot of slavery, rape and killings in those days.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A common theme, which I'm sure happened to many ancient people, is that a neighboring group gains power, comes to your land and takes over. This causes scattering of people, and probably in many cases will exterminate a group of people. That group may just merge into another group, rather than being fully killed off, but the point is that they lose their beliefs, writings, and culture. The Jewish people, however, become very good at being conquered and still managing to hold onto their beliefs and ways of life. Although they consider Israel their land, they seem to do well scattered across Mesopotamia and although they are treated from a range of terrible to tolerated by the Persian, Greek, Roman and Byzantine empires, they generally do quite well, grow their population, refine their laws, and cleverly find spaces where they can act in economic life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These chapters also discuss, briefly, the rise of Christianity, and how its growing influence and eventual takeover as the religion of the Roman Empire affected Jewish people. The author is a Christian, but doesn't spend too much time talking about that one really famous Jew who was born at the time we started the calendar back at zero.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As we learn in general history, there wasn't much interesting in the Middle Ages. However, for the Jews of Spain there was a Golden Age where they lived quite well with the Muslims and Christians. Around this time they produce one of their most famous people, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maimonides"&gt;Maimonides&lt;/a&gt;. I had never heard of him before, but the author spends pages and pages on him. His light burned bright during the otherwise dull period of the middle ages, and contributed a lot to law and ethics as well as medicine. Should I decide to go deeper down this rabbit hole, I'll probably pick up a book about or by him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Johnson describes the various uprisings, pogroms, and expulsions of Jews across Europe and the middle East from the middle ages to the 1800s, including the formation of ghettos (the name of the fourth chapter) and the evolution of antisemitism. The author explains, with many examples, how duplicitous this antisemitism was. One side of the antisemitic argument saw the Jews as this poor, mysterious, mystical, ritualistic, ancient, wandering people. People like that never faired well in medieval times. On the other side, whenever Jews became successful and prosperous, they were thought to have done so at the expense of others through some shady tactics. The governments would react to the later situation often by imposing restrictions on their participation in social and economic life, while mobs and common folk would react to the former situation by burning their homes, synagogues and rioting against them. This pushed the Jews to the fringes of both poverty and innovation/enterprise, which perpetuated the two stereotypes even more! One area of economic life that they basically had a monopoly on was money lending and issuance of credit. Both Christianity and Islam prohibited this for awhile, and even when the Enlightenment rolled around and Christians and secular gentiles in Europe got into the finance game Jews were still able to completely dominate the industry. The role of the "Court Jew" emerged. This was a Jew who worked with the government and nobility, mainly to lend money to finance wars. Many of these names we recognize today, like Oppenheimer and &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rothschild_family"&gt;Rothschild&lt;/a&gt;. These Jews were treated much differently from those in the ghetto. Again though, going back to the duplicitous nature of antisemitism, these super rich and influential Jews fanned the flames for growing conspiracy theorists that a secret society of Jews have been around for thousands of years controlling the world powers with their money. One thing I found interesting was to learn that Karl Marx was actually born a Jew, but renounced his Judaism early on and was very anti-Semitic in his early writings. Later, as his ideas became more refined, he basically replaced Jews with Capitalism in general. But early on he was targeting the Jews especially as exploiters of labor and owners of the means of production.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the 1800s progressed, Jews became emancipated again in some parts of Europe. Indeed, the 5th chapter is called 'Emancipation'. It started in England, which gave many (but not full) rights to Jews and attracted a lot of migrants. Even the PM, David Disraeli, was of Jewish descent. However, he wasn't religiously Jewish - that would have prevented his career in politics - he was baptized early on. Jews started enjoying more freedom in France and Germany as well, and much of the culture in arts, theater, and music in Paris and Berlin (the cultural epicenters of the world at the time) came from Jews. In fact, some of the positive attitudes towards the Jews coming from intellectuals in Paris, especially during the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreyfus_affair"&gt;Dreyfus Affair&lt;/a&gt; played a role in the movement of Zionism, which was led by a guy who was probably heavily featured on &lt;a href="http://mydaguerreotypeboyfriend.tumblr.com/"&gt;My Daguerreotype Boyfriend&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor_Herzl"&gt;Theodor Herzl&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post is getting rather long so I'll wrap it up in a future part 2 . . .&lt;/p&gt;
